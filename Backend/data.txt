Yes, Prophet can be used to predict commodity data for the future based on data that has been collected over the past 5 years. In fact, Prophet is specifically designed to handle this type of univariate time series data and to identify patterns and trends in the data that can be used to make accurate forecasts.

To use Prophet to predict commodity data for the future, you would first need to gather the historical data for the commodity over the past 5 years. You would then input this data into Prophet and use it to generate a forecast for the next year.

Prophet would use the historical data to identify the trend, seasonality, and holiday effects in the data, and to generate a forecast for the future based on these patterns. The forecast would include a prediction for the expected value of the commodity at each point in time, as well as an estimate of the uncertainty associated with the forecast.

It is important to note that the accuracy of the forecast generated by Prophet will depend on a number of factors, including the quality of the historical data, the complexity of the patterns in the data, and the length of the forecast horizon. Therefore, it is important to carefully analyze and validate the forecast generated by Prophet to ensure that it is appropriate for your specific use case.
