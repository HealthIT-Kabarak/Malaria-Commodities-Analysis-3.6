### 1.1 Problem statement
 The restocking of Malaria commodities is currently done based on 6 month averages computed by MoH officials from the KHIS system data. These averages do     not paint a clear picture of trends related to consumption such as seasonality, increases or decreases as well as other confounding factors.
 
### 1.2 Data Engineering
The data engineering process is a crucial component of building a commodity demand prediction model based on historical data. It involves several steps, including data collection, data cleaning, exploratory data analysis (EDA), feature extraction, and model building. Here's an outline of the data engineering process that we followed to develop the malaria commodity demand prediction model:
#### 1.2.1 Data Collection: 
The first step was to collect all relevant data sources that may be useful for building the prediction model. This data included historical data on commodity dispersion over five years to predict future dispersion.
#### 1.2.2 Data Cleaning: 
Once the data was collected, the next step was to clean the data. This includes removing duplicates, dealing with missing values, and handling outliers.
#### 1.2.3 Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):

EDA involved exploring the data to gain a better understanding of the trends and patterns in the data. This involved visualizations, summary statistics, and data transformations.
#### 1.2.4. Feature Extraction: 
In this step, features were extracted from the data to create a set of variables that can be used to build the prediction model. This included the years of dispersion and the data on the diagnostic malaria kits dispersed.
#### 1.2.5. Model Building:
The final step was to build the prediction model using the features extracted from the data. This involved using statistical models such linear regression algorithm.

It's likely that the task of developing the commodity demand prediction model involved an extensive data engineering process that covered all pertinent aspects. The EDA likely involved visualizations and summary statistics to understand the patterns and trends in the data. Data cleaning was crucial to ensure that the data used in the analysis was accurate and reliable. Feature extraction was likely done to create a set of variables that were used in the prediction model. Finally, model building was done using linear regression algorithm to create the final commodity demand prediction model. Overall, the data engineering process was critical in creating an accurate and reliable prediction model that can be used for effective decision-making.

### 1.3 MODEL DEVELOPMENT PROCESS
The model development process was a critical component of creating a commodity demand prediction model based on historical data. Here's an outline of the model development process we followed to develop the malaria commodity demand prediction model:
####1.3.1. Data Preparation: 
    Before building the model, the data needed to be prepared, including cleaning, formatting, and feature extraction. This process involves converting the data into a format that is suitable for model building; converted the data into comma separated file.
####1.3.2. Model Selection:
     The next step was to select an appropriate model that can accurately predict commodity demand based on historical data. This process involved evaluating different models and selecting the best one based on performance metrics such as accuracy, precision, and recall. We selected linear regression algorithm to create the model.
####1.3.3. Model Training: 
Once the model was selected, it needed to be trained using the prepared data. This involved setting aside a portion of the data for training the model and using the remaining data for testing the model. We used 80% of the data for training and 20% for testing the model.
####1.3.4. Model Evaluation: 
After the model was trained, it needed to be evaluated to assess its performance. This involved using performance metrics to measure the accuracy, precision, and recall of the model such as the mean, median and sum of the data.
####1.3.5. Model Optimization: 
If the model's performance is not satisfactory, it needs to be optimized by tweaking the model parameters, adding or removing features, or trying different algorithms. We optimized the data by adding new variables to help in creating the model.
####1.3.6. Model Deployment:
Once the model was optimized and evaluated, it was ready for deployment for use in restocking decision-making.
The task of developing the commodity demand prediction model involved all key model development processes. Model selection was likely done by evaluating different models and selecting the best one based on performance metrics such as accuracy, precision, and recall (linear regression analysis). Model training was probably done using a portion of the data for training and the remaining data for testing. Model evaluation would have been done to assess the model's performance, and model optimization would have been done to improve the model's performance if necessary. Finally, model deployment would have been done to use the model for restocking decision-making. 


It's also likely that the model development process detailed the model selection and its justification, which would have involved evaluating different models and selecting the best one based on performance metrics. Overall, a rigorous model development process was crucial in creating an accurate and reliable prediction model that can be used for effective decision-making.
